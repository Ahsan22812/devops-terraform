# Terraform Best Practices

This Terraform code follows several best practices to ensure maintainability, scalability, and reliability.

## Best Practices Utilized:

- **Separate Provider File:** Providers are defined in a separate file to maintain clarity and organization within the codebase.

- **Backend Configuration:** The Backend block is configured to store Terraform state files in a DynamoDB table for state locking, ensuring consistency and preventing concurrent modifications.

- **Versioning of State Files:** S3 bucket versioning is enabled to track the changes in Terraform state files. This allows for easy rollback and identification of issues.

- **Elastic IP Configuration:** Elastic IP is utilized to assign static public IP addresses to EC2 instances, ensuring consistency and easy accessibility.

- **Effective Use of Variables:** Variables are used to parameterize the Terraform configuration, making it flexible and reusable across environments.

- **Modularization with Modules:** Terraform code is modularized using modules to promote code reuse, maintainability, and scalability.

- **Workspaces Usage:** Workspaces in Terraform are employed to manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) efficiently, allowing for isolation and customization.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Modify the variables and configurations as per your requirements.
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
4. Run `terraform plan` to create an execution plan.
5. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and provision the infrastructure.
